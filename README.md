- This project is a Navigation Assistant that helps users navigate their surroundings using computer vision and text-to-speech (TTS).
- The system captures an image, sends it to an LLM like Gemini for processing, receives navigation instructions, and provides them as audio output.


### Features

- Processes the image with a vision model API.
- Converts navigation instructions to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- Plays audio output to guide the user.
