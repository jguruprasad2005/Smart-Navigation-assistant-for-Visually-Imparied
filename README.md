# Smart Navigation Assistant (still working on this project)

- This project is a Navigation Assistant that helps users navigate their surroundings using computer vision and text-to-speech (TTS).
- The system captures an image, sends it to an LLM like Gemini for processing, receives navigation instructions, and provides them as audio output.


### Key Features

- **Image Capture**  
  Utilizes the Raspberry Pi camera to capture real-time images.

- **Vision Processing**  
  Integrates with a vision model API to analyze captured images and extract useful navigation information.

- **Voice Navigation**  
  Converts navigation instructions into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for audible guidance.

- **Audio Output**  
  Plays voice instructions to assist the user in real-time.

- **GPS Tracking**  
  Continuously tracks the user's location using GPS.

- **Emergency Alert**  
  Includes an emergency button that, when pressed, sends the user's live location to their guardian via email.
